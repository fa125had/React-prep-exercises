# React Optional QA prep exercises - Class44

## Week 1

Possible Q&A exercises are exercises that you can nominate to discuss with the Q&A mentor during the session on Sunday. Have a go at these and see which one you find difficult, then you can reply to the thread in your class channel with a link to the exercise you want to do. Even if the exercise does not get handled in the Q&A session these exercises are good ways to get ideas of what to build to keep practicing.

If you want to nominate a different exercise you found online then feel free to do so! We may even add that one to the list for the next class to use and attribute it to you.

Inside of your React fork, go to the folder week1. Inside of that folder, navigate to /possible-qa-exercises. For each exercise, you will find a separate folder. The README explains what needs to be done. Go through them to practice concepts that you have learned about!
